Usually my bullies would sit just a table away and would purposely talk loudly about me just making fun of everything about me. I would find dirt and old food in backpack, my lunch would disappear (my mom to this day thinks I lost at least four lunch boxes in a year time span), when I would go to the bathroom they would follow me in and trap me in a corner just to push me around and steal my things. No one stood up for me and I truly felt like there was something wrong with me since I had no one.\nTowards the end of the year a new girl came to the school who seemed to be interested in me. She was so pretty and funny that everyone loved her. She was pretty much in every single class of mine and went out of her way to talk to me. I thought she was just being nice or pitied me but I remember going into the locker room for gym and overheard my bullies talking to her just lying to her about all kinds of things. Just making me look like an awful person... I wanted to cry... but I distinctly remember her saying \"What? That doesn't sound like her at all. Why should I believe rumors? Don't talk about my best friend like that.\" From that point onwards I believed whole heartedly in her and we were best friends for years before she moved across the country. \nYou wont see this Hannah but you saved more than you think.

I don't offer them to scare you off or to preach, only as a friendly warning from someone who literally barely survived grad school (there were some very black days...).\n1) Avail yourself of your school's counseling service early on. Clinical depression and anxiety is rampant in grad school partially because of the insane workload, but also because early adulthood is when mental health disorders first manifest. It is easy to feel like you are in over your head, and doubly so in your first year. (I one-more-week'd it for most of my first year.) So your mental health will probably be neglected. Just be aware of the warning signs and seek help before you are in too deep.\n2) You're going to drink. A lot. At parties, group dinners, grad school functions, happy hour, brunch, etc.\u2014basically anywhere where alcohol is cheap/free. It's part social, part stress relief. I don't know if you smoke pot, but it's pretty widely available now, so similar story. Have at them and have a good time doing them. Just be cautious that you don't develop an abusive relationship with them. It might seem like fun or relief, but addiction makes your life way worse. Again, here is where counseling services are useful.\n3) You're going to be immersed in your field, and sometimes all the information will feel like drinking from a fire hydrant. So try not to become myopic in your studies. You'll meet (and commiserate with) some really great people and form lifelong (or at least career-long) relationships with them. Spend your rare free time with them outside doing something fun. Join an intramural team, go on a road trip, or go backpacking.\nGrad school can be hard, but just have faith that its rewards will ultimately outweigh your tribulation. Good luck!\nP.S.:  sci-hub will be your best friend.\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/94b11x/thought_he_was_just_advertising_a_store_at_first/e3k1yow/"}, {"commenter": "wiceo", "comment_text": "This person gets it.\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/94b11x/thought_he_was_just_advertising_a_store_at_first/e3jstyc/"}, {"commenter": "moscatosnice", "comment_text": "I was battling suicidal actions/thoughts....posted my stuff on facebook and was sent to the BHU at the hospital by people who \"care\" about me; in and out of state. \nNone of those people followed up with me.

Had moved around a lot, Mom had been through multiple marriages, Dad was out of the picture.

We had this one older guy on the bus that would always terrorize kids, and he was in rare form that day. Usually it was just spitballs and throwing shit at random targets, but this day he fully committed to my neighbor. He moved and sat right behind him and proceeded to abuse him verbally and physically for a good 5-10 min. No one did anything, high schools or middle schoolers, and I just remembered getting so pissed. I was pretty young at the time and really didn\u2019t know what to say, so I just got up and sat next to him \u201ctoo far back\u201d. He still threw out some snide remarks, but the harassment mostly stopped. Looking back I wish I would have ripped into the kid for being a dick, but it\u2019s amazing what a little bit of support can do. \nI was never really a bully, and never got bullied too badly, but some of the times where I didn\u2019t stand up for someone in that situation still give me guilt. A friend of mine in college used to laugh and tell me how him and his roommates would terrorize this kid down the hall. That kid committed suicide a year later.

I saw her in front of me as another kid shoulder checked her and knocked her over. Something in my heart kind of snapped and I went over to her and asked if she was ok.\nIt broke my fucking heart. I am crying just thinking about it. \nShe was crying and scared and had pissed herself. I held her hand and put my arm around her and started to calm her down. One of my other friends came up and went \" what are you doing?! Did she pee herself haha!\nI grabbed his arm so angrily. I was furious. I yelled \"DONT SAY ANYTHING.

The class was relatively small, and everyone was really friendly and got along exceptionally well. The same group continued into fourth grade - but that year a new kid joined the class. He was awkward, painfully shy, spoke with a slight speech impediment, and just acted differently. Looking back, I'm positive he was on the autism spectrum, but there was no understanding or name for it back then. \nThe kid was bullied, especially by some of my closer friends. Mostly teasing about his clothes and mannerisms, but I could tell it hurt the kid pretty bad. \nOne day he came to school with pants that were probably four sizes too big for him, and no belt. They were just falling off of him. I remember the teacher drawing attention to it, and calling him to the front of the class. She cut and tied a length of string around him to hold his pants up. I remember he looked like Tom Sawyer. \nThis kid's birthday came around and his mom came to class and passed out invitations to his birthday party and Chuck-E-Cheese. I remember a couple kids giving the invitations back to him later saying they weren't coming. It was definitely his mom's idea to invite his classmates to his party, because he never could have done that on his own. \nI knew most of the other kids wouldn't show up, and I didn't really want to go (we were a little too old for it to be \"cool\" to have a birthday party at Chuck-E-Cheese) but I went anyway. \nThere were probably six kids there total - mostly his family - out of the 20 or so they invited. The kid seemed to be having a great time. But what I will always remember is his mom talking to me and calling out the other kids in class, by name, for bullying her son and the things they were doing to him that I never saw. She thanked me for showing up, even thought she knew I probably didn't want to come. It was a lot to take in as a fourth grader, but I was really glad I showed up. All this kid's mom wanted was a semblance of normalcy for her son who just didn't know how to fit in despite his best efforts. \nI have a kid now, and I get how all you want for them is to have the easiest road possible. \n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/94b11x/thought_he_was_just_advertising_a_store_at_first/e3k0p36/"}, {"commenter": "Titanium_Banana", "comment_text": "I struggled to make friends and still do.

So in middle school I was sorta bullied, it hurt a lot but it was manageable because I was only in middle school for 8th grade (homeschool before that). When I got into high school (large school roughly 2000-2500 students) a friend I had made from my church awhile back went there and her and I were best friends. She was very nice to everyone, good looking and charismatic so people from every genre of life sorta flocked to her and the people in our sorta inner circle of friends. Our group sorta became one of the most popular groups in the school and we called our \"click\" floaters because we could converse and talk with pretty much anyone. Throughout our time in high school we sorta flipped the whole normal popularity gimmicks upside down and the nice/nerdy/odd people became the most liked and popular people. I can't tell you how many people after we graduated would come to us and tell us that we saved their lives and that their depression would not have been manageable if it hadn't been for our acceptance and genuine love for people.\nEver since high school I've tried to live by this: love everyone, and if someone doesn't want or \"deserve\" love - keep trying. In the end most people will respect that and look up to that.\nI sometime visit my school to see plays and musicals and I can see even now people were impacted by the people who we impacted still carry on this flipped idea. \nEdit: of course not everything was perfect, not all of it was great and many in our group still struggled and could never love or take care of themselves. love everyone, but also please love yourself, your love for others can never be as genuine as when you come to love yourself.\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/94b11x/thought_he_was_just_advertising_a_store_at_first/e3k3l2t/"}, {"commenter": "Gjlynch22", "comment_text": "A kid I went to school with named Andy was bullied pretty bad. He moved to the US from Vietnam in 6th grade and had a really strong accent even after a few years into high school. He was a really goofy kid, but always had a smile on his face. He played sports, although he never really got into them seriously. He could\u2019ve been a really good football tight end because he was big, could block but was just very clumsy in general. \nAnyway his bullying usually amounted to people goofing on how he would talk, low hanging fruit if you asked me. He was in a handful of my classes freshman year and there were three people who harassed him pretty much every day in each of the classes I was in. Would you be surprised to find out that the three would later become a captain for the football team, hockey team and baseball team?? \nHe always laughed along because he seems to accept that he was just goofy and his personality seemed to always just brush it off. I laughed along like everyone else, especially when our school went through a phase where we would \u201cturtle\u201d people\u2019s backpacks. You essentially distract someone, another person grabs their bag, empties it, turns it inside it and puts the books back in. Usually right before the bell so they don\u2019t have time to undo it before rushing to the next class. \nOne day hockey jock took it too far and while turtling Andy\u2019s bag he poured some of his dipspit into it as well. (Such a fucking badass freshman right?). I\u2019ve never been one to stand up and confront others, especially the popular kids (who I was always friendly with but not actually close friends with) but this lit a fire under my ass. I stood up and out of character I yelled, \u201cdude, what the fuck?! Did you seriously just do that?!\u201d\nHe was shocked and kind of opened his arms to the \u201cwhat?\u201d position. Andy called him out too and called him an asshole, but with his accent it sounded goofy and jock ass decided to use that to make fun of him and do the Asian/Chinese accent and repeated everything Andy was saying. I shook my head and sat down in time before our teacher came back and she yelled at jock asshole. Andy said thanks to me, I felt so fucking bad for the kid because there was like half a water bottle of someone\u2019s spit in his backpack...\nAfter that I was always really aware how funny stuff was originating. If it was at the expense of someone and done maliciously I\u2019d call it out as much as possible. \nA month later in that same class our teacher came in to tell us that Andy had passed away... She said she didn\u2019t know the exact details but he was found with a ski mask on and a pillow on top of his face. Maybe an accident but most likely a suicide. Most of the class was in shock but asshole jock had a fucking grin on his face. \nI snapped. I jumped out of my seat, and tackled the fucking asshole to the ground and got two solid licks in before he pushed me off and I was restrained by some people (I was 5\u20194 and maybe just over 100 lbs soaking wet). I broke his nose pretty good and gave him a fat lip, broke a knuckle in the process.\nTreat people better. Tell your kids to call that shit out as soon as possible while they are younger.

You listen to Noam Chomsky on international state-sponsored terrorism, and it's actually very funny as well as being sad.  The US is full of great comedians who also share awareness of these horrifying acts.  Comedy can co-exist with awareness, activism, even outright rebellion.\nI think it's fine to joke about anything, as long as you don't directly hurt the victims.  A lot of times a joke can help ease somebody into analysis - it isn't always immediately dismissive.\nOverall, I can see your point, but perhaps both approaches can happen - we don't want to JUST laugh, but it is possible to make a few humourous comments while helping, use humour or even outright satire to disarm or destabilize the oppressor.   \n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/94chba/three_journalists_were_killed_in_africa_while/e3kbbhe/"}, {"commenter": "could_gild_u_but_nah", "comment_text": "I just saw your comment about reporters without borders.

He also claimed police had accused Hermitage of tax evasion solely to justify the police raids, so they could take the materials needed to hijack the Hermitage companies and affect the tax refund fraud. Magnitsky's testimony implicated police, the judiciary, tax officials, bankers, and the Russian mafia. In spite of the initial dismissal of his claims, Magnitsky's core allegation that Hermitage had not committed fraud\u2014but had been victimized by it\u2014was eventually validated. A sawmill foreman pleaded guilty in the matter to \"fraud by prior collusion\", though the foreman would maintain that police were not part of the plan. Before then, however, Magnitsky became the subject of an investigation by one of the policemen against whom he had testified as involved in the fraud. According to Browder, Magnitsky was \"the 'go-to guy' in Moscow on courts, taxes, fines, anything to do with civil law.\"\nAccording to Magnitsky's investigation, the documents that had been taken by the Russian police in June 2007 were used to forge a change in ownership of Hermitage. The thieves used the forged contracts to claim Hermitage owed $1 billion to shell companies. Unbeknownst to Hermitage, those claims were later authenticated by judges. In every instance, lawyers hired by the thieves to represent Hermitage (unbeknownst to Hermitage) pleaded guilty on the company's behalf and agreed to the claims, thereby obtaining judgments for debts that did not exist; all while Hermitage officials were unaware of these court proceedings.\nThe new owner, based in Tatarstan, turned out to be Viktor Markelov, a convicted murderer released two years into his sentence.[7] The company's fake debt was used to make the companies look unprofitable in order to justify a refund of $230 million in tax that the companies had paid when they had been under Hermitage's control. The refund was issued Christmas Eve of 2007. It was the largest tax rebate in Russian history.\nHermitage contacted the Russian government with the findings of its investigation. The money, which was not Hermitage's, belonged to the Russian people. Rather than opening a case against the police and the thieves, the Russian authorities opened a criminal case against Magnitsky.\n\nAnd then the brutal torture and death of Magnitsky:\n\nSergei\u2019s captors immediately started putting pressure on him to withdraw his testimony. They put him in cells with 14 inmates and eight beds, leaving the lights on 24 hours a day to impose sleep deprivation. They put him in cells with no heat and no windowpanes, and he nearly froze to death. They put him in cells with no toilet, just a hole in the floor and sewage bubbling up. They moved him from cell to cell in the middle of the night without any warning. During his 358 days in detention he was forcibly moved multiple times.\nThey did all of this because they wanted him to withdraw his testimony against the corrupt Interior Ministry officials, and to sign a false statement that he was the one who stole the $230 million\u2014and that he had done so on my instruction.\nSergei refused. In spite of the grave pain they inflicted upon him, he would not perjure himself or bear false witness.\nAfter six months of this mistreatment, Sergei\u2019s health seriously deteriorated. He developed severe abdominal pains, he lost 40 pounds, and he was diagnosed with pancreatitis and gallstones and prescribed an operation for August 2009. However, the operation never occurred. A week before he was due to have surgery, he was moved to a maximum security prison called Butyrka, which is considered to be one of the harshest prisons in Russia. Most significantly for Sergei, there were no medical facilities there to treat his medical conditions.\nAt Butyrka, his health completely broke down. He was in agonizing pain. He and his lawyers wrote 20 desperate requests for medical attention, filing them with every branch of the Russian criminal justice system. All of those requests were either ignored or explicitly denied in writing.\nAfter more than three months of untreated pancreatitis and gallstones, Sergei Magnitsky went into critical condition. The Butyrka authorities did not want to have responsibility for him, so they put him in an ambulance and sent him to another prison that had medical facilities. But when he arrived there, instead of putting him in the emergency room, they put him in an isolation cell, chained him to a bed, and eight riot guards came in and beat him with rubber batons.\nThat night he was found dead on the cell floor.\n\nThe death of Magnitsky lead to the Magnitsky Act:\n\nSince 2016 the bill, which applies globally, \"authorizes governments to sanction human rights offenders in Russia, freeze their foreign assets, and ban them from entering the signing country.\n\n...which infuriated Putin so much that he barred the US from adopting mentally and physically disabled orphans.  Putin is fucking evil and isn't our friend.  \nPutin is far worse than you think he is:  The Death of Sergei Magnitsky (with Bill Browder)\n\nThe point of modern propaganda isn't only to misinform or push an agenda. It is to exhaust your critical thinking, to annihilate truth.\n\n\nGarry Kasparov\n\nhttps://twitter.com/kasparov63/status/808750564284702720?lang=en\n\nThis isn\u2019t the old Communist scheme of heavy-handed state censorship and official party lines. (The old joke about the two main Soviet papers, Pravda (\u201cTruth\u201d) and Izvestia (\u201cNews\u201d), was \u201cThere\u2019s no news in the Truth and no truth in the News!\u201d) Nor is it the labor-intensive \u201cGreat Firewall of China\u201d model of real-time censorship and high-tech filtering. Befitting Putin\u2019s KGB roots, he instead built an alternate reality of propaganda, one in which there are hundreds of sources and opinions that all may contain elements of fact and fiction while always making sure to keep the larger truths well hidden\u2014and reinforcing support for Putin above all.\n\nThe Truth About Putin by Garry Kasparov\n\u200f\nHere are many articles that show the US government uncovering and recovering millions of dollars that Magnitsky initially found in his investigation:\nhttps://www.occrp.org/en/component/tags/tag/magnitsky\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/94chba/three_journalists_were_killed_in_africa_while/e3kcuew/"}, {"commenter": "PantherChamp", "comment_text": "Just finished reading Red Notice yesterday.

If the universe has taught me anything, it is that nothing happens without a set of principles applied to it within quantifiable logic, sometimes mundane and sometimes completely based off of probability - but always within the context of laws.\n-edit- Imagine if you will, a circle.\nThis circle is just your ordinary geometrical shape, and it's hollow - it has no core, but the actual line of the circle has \"being\", it is measurable and so on, so you decide to examine and zoom on the line itself - what do you find? Imagine finding, another circle. Silly maybe, it's silly for me to try to even explain where I'm going with this, but bear with me. \nYou see this circle and you again, re-examine it and zoom closer, it's now no different than the previous circle except you realize that circle is just very intimately touching another circle in a chain to create one larger circle.

It brings attention to the circle itself, and not so much of the emptiness of the center of the circle, there's truly nothing there.

And since we probably won't figure black holes out in our lifetime, one can ponder this question forever.\nAnother thing one could consider is that our universe might have appeared out of nowhere like subatomic particles popping in and out of existence in the vacuum of space. Those things come in pairs though. One negatively charged and the other one is positive. If our universe followed this model, then the closest things to a positive and negative universes would be matter and anti matter ones. If that were the case, then another universe might exist outside of our own consisting purely of anti matter. And if that were the case, then both will be destroyed if they ever touch each other, which they would if they behave like those particles in space. Those attract because they are polar opposites I guess. Essentially becoming magnets for each other. This could also explain why our universe only seems to have ordinary matter in it. All the anti-matter is in the neighboring universe.\nI'm trying to make a thought provoking comment and do not by any means believe that any of those cases are how our universe actually works. Also, sorry for any potential grammar or spelling errors. I'm from Sweden and English is my second language.\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/9491k3/2_types_of_stoners/e3jervh/"}, {"commenter": "NerdFighter40351", "comment_text": "\nThose things come in pairs though.

A lot of people are saying this is about getting people to buy dongles and accessories, and that's a source of revenue. I don't think that's really Apple's intent though. IMO, Apple doesn't want you to buy dongles period, they're trying to train you out of using physical attachments whatsoever.\nLike, when the MacBook Air was originally announced, people were FURIOUS that it didn't have a disc drive. Check out tech forums at the time. People thought it was ludicrous that Apple was releasing a laptop that didn't have a built-in disc drive for all your CDs and DVDs. Even back then, people were accusing Apple of wanting to make money on USB disc drives, and talking about how inconvenient it was going to be to have to carry those drives around all the time. Apple didn't want you to use a USB disc drive though. Apple wanted you to stop using discs altogether. They wanted you to download apps from the AppStore, and music from iTunes. \nSame here. They're not eliminating HDMI ports so you have to buy a dongle, they're eliminating the HDMI port because they want you to use Bluetooth. They're not eliminated USB ports so you have to buy a dongle to connect your external hard drive, they want you to use iCloud for all your storage. Their \"goal\" is to make their laptops as wireless as possible. Their \"endgame\" is a laptop that you never physically plug into- ever, with any device- other than to charge it.\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/mildlyinfuriating/comments/94b2q8/first_trillion_dollar_company/e3k1lr5/"}, {"commenter": "anothergaijin", "comment_text": "People lost their shit when they released a new OSX on a USB thumb drive instead of a DVD.

I was in Tae Kwon Do when I was younger.  All the fancy breaking that we did was just to show off and have fun.  Board breaking has no practical use at all, it's just fun and it looks cool..\nBrick breaking is the same.  People think it's a huge feat of strength to break a stack of like 5 or 6 bricks, but it's really not.   They're made from fairly lightweight porous concrete, not true brick or stone, and we put spacers between them so the first strike only needs to break one brick, then you follow through and break the second, third, fourth, etc, while the weight and momentum of the bricks above assist you on the way down.\nBreaking 2 bricks is no harder than breaking 1.  Breaking 3 takes only marginally more force.  Once you get up to 4 it's really just about mastering the technique.  As you start going through more and more bricks it becomes harder to keep your momentum going straight down and eventually you drift off to one side of the other and you'll stop making it through.   Also the bricks start falling inwards toward your arm and elbow and that friction starts to slow you down just a little.  So you do have to hit harder, but not nearly as much as people think.\nThe most I've ever attempted is 5, and I succeeded.  Most I've ever seen attempted in person is 8, and he left 2 intact. \nedit:  I may have undersold this a little.  It IS a difficult thing to do.  And breaking boards is different than bricks.  Bricks are damn near impossible to break in a stack if you don't use spacers.  People increase or decrease the difficulty by changing the width of the spacers.  People often use pennies for this purpose.  Standard width I'd say is about a 4-5 penny stack, though I've also seen people use 3/8th to 1/2 inch wooden spacer sticks.  Want to show how strong and skillful you are?  use a 3 penny spacer.  That's more impressive than adding one more brick.\nBoards are different though.  You dont' space boards, they're stacked directly in contact with each other, so breaking 2 boards really is just about twice as hard as breaking 3.  The trick here though is we're breaking them WITH the grain.   Breaking boards are almost always pine in my personal experience.  You buy a long plank of 1x6 or 1x8 and cut it into about a 12 inch long section.  When you strike it the board will break pretty cleanly right along the grain.

People who don't usually do martial arts will get frazzled thinking the board will break them, when really it's all about committing to the action and perfecting your technique to actual work.\nI've seen people who worry about breaking their own fingers on boards that are the same thickness as their own thumbs, it's really all a mental test of whether 1. you can do the technique and 2. can you commit to the action and not stop midway.\nBricks/multiple boards force the person to perfect their technique further + additional force.

I'd never tried that one before, and my first time attempting it was during a public demonstration.  Whoops.\nGot it on the second try, though.

Taekwondo was developed in the early 1900s largely by General Choi Hong Hi, a Korean army general who \"created\" the martial art during his time at the Korean Military Academy in Seoul after his imprisonment and torture in Japan. The prominent martial arts in Korea at the time were essentially styles of Japan's karate (i.e. Tang Soo Do); however, Choi wanted to make an inherently Korean martial art (for obvious reasons pertaining to Japanese imperialism). He got the name from an ancient Korean martial art called \"Taekkyeon\", which was actually more of a sport/game/dance between practitioners in traditional festivals and performances. From there, he built upon the previous system with new forms and movements, all while promoting the idea that Taekwondo was a product of Taekkyon and ancient Korean martial arts used by legendary, most likely mythical, warriors known as the hwarang from 1300 years prior. Furthermore, the implementation of board breaking and acrobatic jumping/spinning kicks was in part a strategy to spread Taekwondo's influence into countries such as Vietnam and later Europe.\nAs such, taekwondo was not used during the period of horseback riders. Furthermore, the idea of traditional, hwarang-era, Korean martial arts including (effective) kicking movements against horseback riders is almost definitely a romantic martial art fantasy. Thinking from a common sense standpoint, soldiers wearing armor would not be able to perform these acrobatic kicks to knock a man off a galloping horse.\nTL;DR: Taekwondo's \"air moves\" were not used to fight people on horses. \nSource: \nTaekwo\u0306ndo Hyo\u0306ndaesa\nTAEKWONDO: from a Martial Art to a Martial Sport\nChoi's Encyclopedia of Taekwondo\nT'aekw\u014fndo: The Way of Taekwondo.

NYC and SF are often touted as the biggest examples, but this is a crisis affecting nearly every urban area in America. \nAnother problem is a complete lack of political desire to stop the crisis. People in these cities do not want to see their homes drop in price, they want their homes to constantly go up in price. The other big issue is that foreign investors often buy up luxury housing in many cities, keeping the luxury market extremely expensive, meaning rich people who would move into those apartments instead move to middle class housing, displacing people and raising prices for everyone. A vacancy tax, or a tax on foreigners buying property, would solve this. But homeowners want to keep prices rising, so the crisis continues. \nPeople who own 3,000,000 dollar brownstones in Brooklyn that they bought for 100,000 bucks in the 80s can deal with a fucking drop in their housing price if it means poor people can actually live in their neighborhoods. \nOur current housing economy entirely favors those who are older and wealthier and own homes.

It's quite common for more sociable dogs to learn what expressions elicit responses and make them a lot, like giving you puppy dog eyes or making a big goofy grin when they want to play. A lot of dogs learn to smile or pose for the camera, too.\nSo some dogs may in fact smile and mean it, though a dog's \"smile\" doesn't necessarily mean what a human smile does. They could be making the face from anxiety, fear, excitement, because you're smiling and they wanna mimic you, etc. The biggest answer is when you own a pet you eventually just learn what their expressions mean and how to tell their mood, it can vary. They're doing the same to you, your dog will learn your facial expressions and mood cues amazingly well. In my experience dogs do a majority of their expressions with their ears, eyes, and tail, rather than with their mouths or by making faces. My one dog will express to you how he feels and what he wants by just looking up and moving his ears, and maybe giving a good wag of the tail. His much less subtle brother just bulldozes into you and makes it real clear.\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/rarepuppers/comments/949kn4/doggo_knows_whats_about_to_happen/e3ka3c7/"}, {"commenter": "YoungPhobo", "comment_text": "To answer your last question: no.

We buy a house together. She suddenly gets pregnant when she's 45, which is odd because she didn't want kids. Five months into the pregnancy (when she knows it's going to hold) she wants out of the relationship and tells me to move on. No intimacy from that point forward. I stay with her for another year and a half as \"roommates\" in my own house raising my son hoping that she'd turn around but she tells me that I have no choice, I need to move on. I find another girlfriend and she's happy... for about a week. She gets angry when she finds out that my new girlfriend is much younger and demands that I give her all our pictures and her files that are on my computer. In those files I find that she's been having an affair with her friend's husband for over a decade and also began taking fertility medication about a year before she got pregnant.\nShe files a bogus protection from abuse order to get me kicked out of my own house (no evidence is needed for those), prevents me from seeing my son, and we have a child custody trial. I'm prevented from bringing up any evidence of the affair or deception about the fertility drugs. I cannot introduce video of her hitting me (considered hearsay). Somehow she IS allowed to bring up my new relationship and paints the narrative that I just left my family for a younger woman. \nNow I can't go into my own house, can only see my son for a weekend every 2 weeks, and I'm paying her about $1,300 a month. To sum it up, I'm faithful to her the entire time, she cheats on me for a decade, takes fertility medication to get pregnant, breaks up with me once she knows the pregnancy will hold, gets the police to kick me out of my own house and I have to pay her $1300. \nHow is this fair?

Neither party is really at fault,  unlike in the \"abusive rich husband/poor abused wife\" scenario you made. \nYou're not entitled to a lifestyle just because you're used to it. I'm sure the kids will be fine: they're still the children of a billionaire who presumably loves them more than his wife. So, this is ultimately a decision for her between how much she likes being rich vs. how much she hates getting beaten. If she's getting beaten that badly, it shouldn't really be that difficult of a decision you make. I know that sounds harsh, but hey. They've been married 10 years, dated prior to that for who knows how long, and she never set up a cash pipeline of her own? No business--nothing? Sounds like she was just betting her whole life on things working out for her marriage, rather than taking care of her own future, like a responsible adult. And the bet didn't go in her favor. I don't see why she should get a multi-million dollar consolation prize for that. \nAlso, the median income is closer to ~$60k now. Not the same as being a billionaire, but not exactly an economic death sentence. If you can't make something out of yourself with a free ~$60k check every year, then that's on you as a person. \nPay for her university tuition, a live-in nanny to watch the kids until she graduates, and all the other necessary stuff for the children's welfare.

Chilas is a extremely radical town with a huge presence of primarily anti-minority militants. When I passed this town a few years ago, they actually had a message engraved on a large stone that said \"We welcome enemies of Shia and Ahmedi\". Another engraving said \"A public murder of a Shia is a virtuous act\". Shia and Ahmedi are persecuted minorities in Pakistan and it was pretty scary passing through this town as a Shia.\nThe people of this town are also responsible for several incidents a few years ago when a group of people dressed in army uniform would stop buses, unload the people, check ID cards to identify people with Shia names, line them up and then shoot them dead.\nMore here: https://www.dawn.com/news/742618\nAnd here, an article where the police identifies the criminals as hiding in Chilas: http://www.shiitenews.org/index.php/pakistan/item/1533-kohistan-babusar-tragedies-hazara-police-claim-to-have-traced-nasbi-takfiri-terrorists/1533-kohistan-babusar-tragedies-hazara-police-claim-to-have-traced-nasbi-takfiri-terrorists\nThe people of this town are also responsible for the 2013 Nanga Parbat massacre of foreign climbers looking to scale the world's third-highest mountain.\nYou can read more about it (and the subsequent arrests from Chilas) here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_Nanga_Parbat_massacre\nWhere were the police and army? The police has a history of not messing with militants, especially in a militant town. If there was any police around, their standard operating procedure upon seeing a mob of militants burning schools would be to find a safe place to hide. The army, however, has always treated militant groups in this region as \"strategic assets\" which could be used against India in case of a war, so they won't let the law enforcement act on anyone other than a few direct perpetrators.\nLast, I do want to mention that Gilgit-Baltistan as a whole is the complete opposite of Chilas. A majority of the people of this region are Shia and rest of the population is also very diverse. Literacy rate is the highest in Pakistan at 72% despite being an economically disadvantaged region. You travel to an town in Gilgit-Baltistan, and the first thing that strikes you as different is that every single girl or boy you see is dressed in a school uniform and these kids walk miles every day to get to school, both girls and boys. They are beautiful, loving, hospitable and down-to-earth people living in a beautiful land. They deserve better.\nYou can read more about the region here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgit-Baltistan\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/948mfr/12_girls_schools_burnt_down_overnight_in_pakistan/e3jlqrf/"}, {"commenter": "frogtotem", "comment_text": "I dont know from where you came, but in third world countries, we have these things \nthe State can't reach the entire population.

Plenty of Islamic Sects have Strongholds across Pakistan since our Government doesn't favour one specific side (Shia, Sunni, Wahabbi etc) This one in particular had Ahl-e-Tashee having a Stronghold in their area and some of the youths had links to ISIS,\nOur Military launched Operation Zarb-e-Azb\nr/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Zarb-e-Azb\nIn June 2014 to clear out these Terrorists and had a major success in clearing out Wazirstan (Home to Al Qaeda and Haqqani network agents in Pakistan)\nThe Army managed to destroy them all and clear Pakistan from them. However they are still camped on the Afghanistan Side and since Afghanistan has a Hostile Attitude (Owing to its Political leanings and Friendship with India) so Cross Border Operations didn't happen.\n.\nHowever in 2017 the damned Terrorists struck again like roaches congregating and attacked a Military School. \nOur Military responded once more with Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Radd-ul-Fasaad\nOnce again we managed to drive them all out of Pakistan \nBut again, it seems suspciously as if our neighbors don't want the terrorists to be rooted out. Our country's economy is already suffering yet we get accused of Harboring and Sponsoring Terrorists while our Soldiers shed blood day after day to drive them off.\n.\nComing to point here as of recently. The Terrorists, reeling from their efforts in the North, moved further up North to the remote regions of Baltistan and have attacked there once more.\n.\nMy point:\nFor everyone here calling out Islam as a Disease or that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia should be shut down\nI'm shedding light on the efforts of my Country in containing this disaster. I myself had once been threatened with a terrorist ploy in my home city (2008) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad_Marriott_Hotel_bombing)\nWe Pakistanis have no sympathy for these terrorists that Flog the name of our religion.\nCall them Extremists or Radical Islamists but I'll assure you they aren't what Islam represents. They are Terrorists, and on their end the Depressing part is they themselves don't realise what they doing is wrong because they have been Brainwashed.\n.\nLastly, Regarding the \"Girls\" School part. Segregation is a cruel word for something part of the Nation's Culture and Tradition. Co-ed Schools are very rare since the State Religion is Islam so Boys and Girls share Primary Education uptill 6th Grade after which they are separated. This is because such a stage is volatile for the youth and in order to maintain decency and teach the Youth Proper Islamic Manners and teachings they are schooled separately (This is another controversial topic which is up for debate even among Islamic Sects). This lasts until they finish Secondary Education and advance to Universities where it is Co-Ed and more familiar. \n.\nTl;dr\n1: Islam is not being Represented Here\n2: Pakistan isn't sitting around twiddling its thumbs, it is working to stage a Surgical Counterstrike\n3: The Fight Against such Terrorists is alive and well and continuously intensified\nAs a final note:\nThe Will of the People of Pakistan (And Islam) Against Terrorism is Encapsulated in the Pakistan National Action Plan:\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Action_Plan_(Pakistan))\n", "permalink": "https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/948mfr/12_girls_schools_burnt_down_overnight_in_pakistan/e3jtzt5/"}]}]
